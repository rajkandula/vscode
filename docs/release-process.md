# Release Process

This document describes how to build and publish signed releases for VS Code.

## Preparing a Release
1. Ensure the `main` branch is up to date and that CI passes.
2. Update version numbers and changelog as needed.
3. Create a tag `vX.Y.Z` and push it to GitHub.

## Build and Test
The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs automatically for tags and on demand. It:

1. Installs dependencies with `yarn --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Runs unit tests using `npm test`.
3. Builds the product with `yarn gulp vscode-{platform}` for:
   - `win32-x64` on Windows
   - `darwin` on macOS
   - `linux-x64` on Linux

## Signing
Each build is signed using platform-specific scripts invoked by the workflow. Signing certificates and keys are supplied through repository secrets.

## Publishing
Built archives are uploaded as workflow artifacts. When the workflow is triggered by a tag, a release job publishes those artifacts to GitHub Releases. The same artifacts can also be pushed to an internal package registry if required.

## Manual Distribution
After the workflow completes, download installers or archives from the release and distribute them through the approved channels.
