# Contribution Guide

Follow the existing workflow for issues and pull requests. In addition:

- Every feature pull request must create or update relevant documentation in this `docs/` directory.
- Documentation completeness is reviewed at each project milestone.

Keeping the documentation accurate ensures the project remains approachable to new contributors.
