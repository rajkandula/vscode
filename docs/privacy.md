# Privacy

This build of VS Code collects minimal usage data to help improve the product. Telemetry is sent only to the configured endpoint.

## Opt out

You can disable all telemetry by setting the environment variable `VSCODE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=none` before launching the application. Telemetry can also be disabled in the application settings by setting `"telemetry.telemetryLevel": "off"`.
